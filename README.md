# Autonomous-Car-Control-Project
Hello everyone!
This repository is made for any discussions and sharing of codes for our autonomous car project. 
Attached, you can find a short basic manual to allow the car to map and navigate through an environment.

More guidelines will be provided in due course. For now, we have uploaded several relevant documents for you to explore the car on your own!

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Dr. Xu (pbing.xu@polyu.edu.hk) or Sergio (sergio.vicenzo@connect.polyu.hk)
